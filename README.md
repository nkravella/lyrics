Tamil lyrics are written out in English, numbered, and *italicized*.
Line translation follows and is in **bold**.

**A few terms:**

    Sapthaka ('saptha' = 7 + notes): sa ri ga ma pa dha ni (Latin --> do re mi fa so la ti).

    Varnam (song structure) = pallavi (intro verse) --> anupallavi (fill) --> charanam (verses 2 & 3) --> chittha swara (acts as bridge).
    
    Swara: An abstract octave with variable frequencies and predefined intervals. Ragas are made of various swaras.

    Chitta Swara: Ancient devotional embellishments meant to accompany ragas.

    This song is composed within the framework of Raga Abheri. 

### Prelude (0:16 to 0:46)

*Pa-pa-ni pa-ni pa-ma*

*Pa-ni pa-ma ga-ma-pa sa-ga-sa-ni*

*Pa-ni pa-ma ga-ma-ga sa-ga-ma-pa*

*Thagra-thagra-thagradhim thagra-thagra-thagradhim thagra-thagra-thagradhim thagajam* (x2)

thagra = tha + ga + ra; thagradhim = thagra + dhim; thagajham = tha + ga + jham

    'tha,' 'dhim,' and 'jham' are onomatopoeic syllables that:
    - let the percussionists know how to follow (i.e. with a "dhim" on the tabla, or a "jham" on the tanpura to create resonance)
    - announce / reiterate the time signature (which is called "tal" in Hindi, "thalam" in Tamil and Telugu)
