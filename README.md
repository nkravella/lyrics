### Vocal Fill A

*Thagra-thagra-thagradhim thagra-thagra-thagradhim thagra-thagra-thagradhim thagajam*

thagra = tha + ga + ra
thagradhim = thagra + dhim
thagajham = tha + ga + jham

here 'tha,' 'dhim,' and 'jham' are onomatopoeic syllables that serve two functions:
- let the percussionists know how to follow (i.e. with a "dhim" on the tabla, or a "jham" on the tambourine / cymbals)
- announce / keep up the time signature (i.e. "taal" in Hindi, "thalam" in Tamil and Telugu)

Note that is a very classical / carnatic way of singing; represents classical music.
